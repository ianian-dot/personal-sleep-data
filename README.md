# Personal sleep project 

Project outline

* Objective : for my personal understanding of deep sleep, its variance and its predictors. As a bit of a sleep nerd, I want to know what factors influence my deep sleep, so that I can best optimise my life around maximising deep sleep. 

* Rationale/ Incentive for project : have always been interested in sleep since a young age. Even in high school, where the pressures of juggling extra cirricular activities such as sports and academic workload nudged many of my peers into developing poor sleep habits or sleeping less, I have always prioritised sleep. 

I am highly sensitive to sleep, often finding myself deeply affected in terms of mood, motivation and focus whenever I fail to get enough hours. Although I have been able to mitigate that in recent times by simply not thinking too much about the amount of sleep I have gotten if I failed to sleep enough the night before (psychological/placebo effect), this is still an area I would want to optimise in order to not lose out on too many happier and productive days. 

* Data: 

    * Outcome variable : Deep sleep (minutes)

    * Factors considered 
        1. Exercise and calories burnt 
        2. Alcohol
        3. Gaming 
        4. Caffeine
        5. Eating before sleeping (personal addiction)

* Data collection methods 
    * Deep sleep amount: AutoSleep app on Apple Watch SE (occasionally cross checked against Health app)
    * Exercise and calories burnt: Activity/Fitness/Health app on Apple Watch SE and iPhone 
    * Coffee: conversion to caffeine in mg is tricky due to extraction/brewing method. Currently mainly using pourover with V60, and due to variations in pour methods it is hard to pinpoint a value for the amount of caffeine. 
    * Gaming and alcohol: currently for simplicity, capturing the rough amount of alcohol for my personal taste/tolerance. Unlikely to be generalised to the general alcohol consumer since I drink quite little. Also captured hours to sleep to factor in the amount of time for alcohol to be broken down and removed from the system. For gaming, only capturing an indication variable of whether I gamed or not, and the time I stopped.

* Data entry and importing 
   * Data was collected into a google sheet via the use of a google form.
   * [Created an API from google drive to read into Python/Pandas](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-read-and-write-data-to-google-spreadsheet-using-python-ebf54d51a72c)
